For the CS algorith we start running the algorithm and as the time passes more processes arrive. We sort the processes that have arrived by the shortest running time and we add them to the queue to run later. From Performance statistics the cs algorithm has a Time Overhead: 9.50, 6.96 and Turnaround time: 209 compared to ff with Time overhead: 25.50 13.39 and Turnaround time: 285 and compared to RR algorithm with Time overhead: 23.85 14.90 and Turnaround time 460. We can clearly distinguish the superiority of the cs algorithm.
For the CM algorithm we use the most-recently executed process in order to evict pages when we run out of space. With the Performance Statistics we observe for CM algorithm Time overhead: 15.67 11.20 and Turnaround time: 735. In contrast for Swapping (P) we get Time overhead 15.75 12.32 and Turnaround time 838 and for the Virtual Memory (V) we get Time overhead: 18.63 13.09 and Turnaround time: 858. The CM algorithm is slightly better in this instance against Swapping and clearly a big difference between CM and V, with the winner being CM.
